# Activity Overview
In this activity i was to visualize data from the Minnesota Department of Transportation to help them improve the infrastructure on the Minneapolis interstate.

In this activity i was able to connect with stakeholders business needs in my visuals.

## The most important charts needed to show

* Traffic volume throughout the year; ideally organized by year, month, weekday, and hour.

* Traffic volume in various weather conditions.

* Traffic volume on different holidays.

## Dashboard
I created an interactive dashboard that met the needs of the client who wanted to compare the traffic volumes at different points in time.They also wanted to check how holidays and weather 

patterns throughout the year affected the traffic volumes.
